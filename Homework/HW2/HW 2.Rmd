## Data visualization tasks with `loans_full_schema` data set



Finish the following data visualization tasks using the `loans_full_schema` data set in `openintro` library. For each task, you need to summarize what you learn from the graph accurately and comprehensively (but donâ€™t over-read your graph).

Here is a preview of the dataset:


```{r loans_full_schema}
tibble(loans_full_schema)
```


### 1. Create a histogram of a numeric variable that you select and plot a density curve on top of the histogram. Carefully select bin numbers/sizes/boundaries to make the plot informative.


For this question, I've selected the `annual_income` variable and plotted it on a graph. 
I've excluded all data points above 500k/year as those were rather extreme outliers which hindered visualization of the greater picture.

For this dataset, it seems that most who take out a loan have a median income of around $65,000. The middle 50% of people this dataset, 
as evident by the 5 number summary below, have an income between $45,000 and $95,000.


```{r numdensity}
ggplot(data = loans_full_schema, aes(x = annual_income)) +
    geom_histogram(aes(y = after_stat(density)),
    fill = "magenta", color = "magenta", binwidth = 10000) +
    geom_density(color = "blue", size = 2) +
    labs(x = "Annual Income (USD)", y = "Density",
    title = "Annual Income of Borrowers") +
    xlim(0, 500000) +
    theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))

fivenum(loans_full_schema$annual_income)
```


### 2. Create a density plot with aesthetic grouping or ridged density plot to compare the effect of a categorical/discrete variable on the distributions of a numeric variable.


For this question, I chose to compare the density functions for credit limit against people with income statuses ranging from 
Verified, Source Verified, and Not Verified. 

It seems that those with a verified source of income have a greater chance of obtaining a higher credit limit. 
This is evident in the blue and green graph as total credit limit approaches 1e+06, there is still a percentage of people 
who have obtained a higher credit limit.  


```{r ridged_density}
ggplot(data = loans_full_schema,
aes(x = total_credit_limit, y = verified_income)) +
    geom_density_ridges(alpha = 0.5,
    aes(fill = verified_income, color = verified_income)) +
    labs(x = "Total Credit Limit (USD)", y  = "Source Status",
    title = "Total Credit Limit vs Income Status") +
    theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```


### 3. Create a bin heatmap to study the relationship between two numeric variables.


In this plot, interest rates were compared with respective annual incomes.


It seems that interest rates seemed to vary and mostly hovered bwtween 5% and 20%. 
It also looks like most people in this dataset are making around or below $200,000/year. 
From the graph, we can see that as Annual Income approaches $0/year, the interest rate becomes volatile and the density of datapoints begins to increase. 


```{r bin_heatmap}
ggplot(data = loans_full_schema) +
    geom_bin_2d(aes(x = annual_income, y = interest_rate / 100)) +
    scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent, limits = c(0, 0.35)) +
    labs(x = "Annual Income (USD)", y = "Interest Rate",
    title = "Interest Rate compared with Annual Income") +
    theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```


### 4. Use `facet_wrap` to create an informative plot.


I used `facet_wrap` to examine the relationship between annual income and the total credit limit 
for people taking out a loan belonging to 3 different categories pertaining to their homeownership status: Existing Morgage, Own Property, and Rented Property.


The results were that those who lived in a morgage tended to have a much higher credit limit when compared with those with other statuses.
While people who rent a place to live have the least credit availability, those who own their property only have a greater credit limit compared 
with those renting their house.


One explanation might be becasue people who take out a loan, especially a large loan for their house, go through a lengthy approval process 
which ensures they have the financial capabilities to pay the loan back. Through this, their credit score increases dramatically 
which grants them a higher credit limit. Those who own their houses might not have a long history of borrowing or might even have limited 
financial capabilities. Their house might be inherited, and for said reasons among others, house ownership does not neccecarily speak to 
one's financial capabilities. On the other hand, it is understandable that those who rent their home have a low credit limit as their living 
situation is likely to be more volatile than others.


```{r facet_wrap}
ggplot(data = loans_full_schema,
aes(x = annual_income, y = total_credit_limit)) +
    facet_wrap(~ homeownership) +
    geom_point(aes(color = verified_income)) +
    labs(x = "Annual Income (in USD x 10^3)", y = "Total Credit Limit (USD)",
    title = "Annual Income with the corresponding Credit Limit") +
    ylim(0, 1000000) +
    scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::dollar_format(scale = 1e-3),
    limits = c(0, 350000)) +
    theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```


Here is the image in a higher resolution for greater clarity.


```{r image, fig.align = 'center', out.width = "120%"}
knitr::include_graphics("/Users/jacky/Documents/SEM 3/STA 305/Homework/HW 2/facet_wrap.img", error = FALSE)
```


### 5. Use `facet_grid` to create an informative plot.


Here, I used the same variables as above but added another category to see who was taking out the loan. 
It seems that there are a fair number of applicants who are applying jointly and it seems that they, 
on average, have a lower credit limit compared with the individual counterparts. 


For example, those in the rent category who are applying jointly are eligible, on average, for 
less credit compared with their individual counterparts. This is the same across all three 
homeownership statuses and may be an indication that those who wish to jointly apply for a loan are at a disadvantage. 


```{r facet_grid, out.width="120%"}
table(loans_full_schema$application_type)

ggplot(data = loans_full_schema,
aes(x = annual_income, y = total_credit_limit)) +
    facet_grid(homeownership ~ application_type) +
    geom_point(aes(color = verified_income)) +
    labs(x = "Annual Income (USD)", y = "Total Credit Limit (USD)",
    title = "Annual Income with the corresponding Credit Limit",
    subtitle = "Seperated into Individual/Joint
    loan and Homeownership status") +
    xlim(0, 350000) + ylim(0, 1000000) +
    theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```


```{r image2, fig.align = 'center', out.width = "120%"}
knitr::include_graphics("/Users/jacky/Documents/SEM 3/STA 305/Homework/HW 2/facet_grid.jpg")
```


## Data visualization and exploration tasks with `gpa` data set The `gpa` data set is available through `openintro` package in R.


Here is a preview of the dataset:


```{r gpa}
tibble(gpa)
```


### 1. By doing your own research, give the meaning of each variable to your understanding. 


The survey is a survey with a sample size of 55 students from Duke University. They are asked about their GPA, 
number of hours they study at night, number of nights they go out, and their gender.


### 2. Does more study hours lead to higher gpa for this data set?


While it seems that guys might hit a sweet spot by studying less, 
girls seem to have the same GPA regardless of how much they study.
However, it is still worth noting that the dataset is too small to provide significant results.


```{r hours_gpa}
ggplot(gpa, aes(x = gpa, y = studyweek)) +
    geom_point(aes(color = gender)) +
    geom_smooth(aes(fill = gender)) +
    labs(x = "GPA", y = "Hours/Week",
    title = "Hours studied/week vs GPA") +
    ylim(0, 60) + xlim(3, 4) +
    theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```


### 3. Does more going-out nights lead to lower `gpa` for this data set?


It seems that while for girls, there seems to be a certain correlation bewteen going out 
and a higher GPA, the same cannot be said for boys. However, given the small dataset, 
all assumptions remain volatile by nature.


```{r out_gpa}
ggplot(gpa, aes(x = gpa, y = out)) +
    geom_point(aes(color = gender)) +
    geom_smooth(aes(fill = gender)) +
    labs(x = "GPA", y = "Nights/Week",
    title = "Nights out/week vs GPA") +
    xlim(3, 4) +
    theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```


### 4. Is there a correlation between sleeping hours and the number of going-out nights?


While the dataset is quite small, the number of hours 
slept seems to increase as the number of nights out increases.


```{r sleep_gpa}
ggplot(gpa, aes(x = out, y = sleepnight)) +
    geom_point() +
    geom_smooth() +
    labs(x = "Nights Out", y = "Hours/Day",
    title = "Average hours slept/day vs Nights Out") +
    theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```


### 5. Do female students study more hours than male students in the data set?


I think girls tend to study better, especially when 
looking at the 5 number summary, where every single value 
is greater for girls compared with guys.


```{r gb_gpa}
ggplot(gpa, aes(x = studyweek, y = gender)) +
    geom_boxplot(aes(fill = gender)) +
    labs(x = "Hours studied per week", y = "Gender",
    title = "Gender vs Hours studied per week") +
    theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))

male <- filter(gpa, gender == "male")
fivenum(male$studyweek)

female <- filter(gpa, gender == "female")
fivenum(female$studyweek)
```


### 6. Do male students go out more than female students in the data set?


Yes, it seems that boys go out more compared with girls.


```{r gb_out}
ggplot(gpa, aes(x = out, y = gender)) +
    geom_boxplot(aes(fill = gender)) +
    labs(x = "Nights out per week", y = "Gender",
    title = "Gender vs Nights out per week") +
    theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```


### 7. Compare people that go out the most with how much they sleep.


It seems that there are is no significant relationship between 
nights spent out and the hours slept. The graphs were adjusted to fill the entire bar to 
see the relative proportions of people who went out given the hours slept. One can see 
that the numbers are relatively uniform. 


```{r sleep_out}
ggplot(gpa, aes(x = sleepnight)) +
    geom_bar(aes(fill = as.factor(ceiling(out))), position = "fill") +
    scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent, limits = c(0, 1)) +
    labs(x = "Hours Slept", y = "Percentage",
    title = "Nights out vs. hours slept") +
    scale_fill_discrete(name = "Nights Spent Out") +
    theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```
